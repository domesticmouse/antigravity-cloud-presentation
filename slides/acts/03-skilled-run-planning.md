Now, let's look at Run 2: the Skilled Run. We start with the exact same project goal, but first we install Matt Pocock's agent skills collection and drive the work through /wayfinder, /grilling, /domain-modeling, /prototype, /to-spec, and /to-tickets.

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1 text-gray-300">
      <li>Instead of holding an entire system design inside one giant chat thread, <code>/wayfinder</code> charts a shared map (<code>map.md</code>) and slices open questions into focused decision tickets.</li>
      <li>Each session resolves <strong>one</strong> decision ticket, writes the resolution to disk, and is followed by <code>/clear</code>.</li>

  </li>
</ol>

<!--
Why does /wayfinder work so well across /clear boundaries? Because it refuses to keep decisions trapped in chat memory. First, it charts a map of open architectural and domain questions on disk. Then, in each session, it combines /grilling and /domain-modeling to resolve a single ticket, immediately updating GLOSSARY.md and ADRs before you run /clear.

Let's watch Session 1 of the Skilled Run. At stop points 1 and 2, we run npx skills add mattpocock/skills to install 38 skills into .agents/skills. Then at stop point 5, we invoke /wayfinder. Notice how the agent interviews us across 11 breadth-first questions—covering BOM scope, structured schemas, single-user local operation, and our standing preference for Rust, HTMX, and local Turso—before writing GLOSSARY.md, ADR 0001, map.md, and 5 decision tickets at stop point 28.

Here in Sessions 2 through 5, I clear the context window before every single ticket and simply type /wayfinder. Each fresh session reads map.md and GLOSSARY.md from disk, claims the next unblocked decision ticket, and grills me on the edge cases: Ticket 01 resolves the 9-category taxonomy and multi-location Stock Lots; Ticket 02 resolves the 5-state BOM fulfilment lifecycle; Ticket 03 resolves CSV import and multi-build shopping list shortfall maths; and Ticket 04 locks the 5 deep Rust modules and Turso database architecture.

<!--
Which leads me to an interesting realisation: look at the domain richness that emerged from those four Wayfinder sessions—none of which was in my initial prompt! When the agent asked what happens if I have two bags of the same op-amp in different drawers (because it was faster to order a fresh bag than find the first one), we arrived at hierarchical Storage Locations and Stock Lots. And when it probed partial builds and substitutions, we arrived at a 5-state BOM fulfilment model and cross-build Net Shortfall maths.

In Sessions 6, 7, and 8, we finish planning. At stop points 82 through 87, Ticket 05 invokes the /prototype skill to build a self-contained HTML file with three interactive layout variants—Variant A Workbench Split-Pane, Variant B Dense Datasheet Grid, and Variant C Kanban Cards—so we can inspect them in a browser and pick Variant A. Then at stop point 94 we run /to-spec after /clear to compile spec.md, and at stop point 99 we run /to-tickets to slice the build into 8 vertical implementation tickets.

Pause and look at what sits on disk at the end of Session 8, before a single line of Rust application code has been written: a 14-term GLOSSARY.md, ADR 0001, a 3-variant HTML UI prototype, a 213-line specification, and 8 vertical slice tickets. Any engineer—or any fresh agent session after /clear—can pick up this repository and know every invariant.
