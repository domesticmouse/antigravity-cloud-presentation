## Codelab Mission: Neither Approach Is Always Right or Always Wrong

When you sit down with an AI coding agent like Google Antigravity (`agy`), you have two fundamentally different ways of working:

1. **Vibe Coding (Rapid Exploration)**: Give the agent a high-level prompt, answer a few quick questions, and let it build a working prototype in 15 minutes.
2. **Skill-Driven Engineering (`/wayfinder` & Composable Skills)**: Equip the workspace with Agent Skills (`mattpocock/skills` and `google/skills`) to interview you deeply, commit a domain glossary (`GLOSSARY.md`), record Architecture Decision Records (`docs/adr/`), prototype UI variants, slice vertical tickets, and build with TDD and automated code review across `/clear` session boundaries.

**The goal of this Codelab is not to make you copy-paste my audio electronics inventory app.** Instead, we use the recorded **Baseline Run** (`01-baseline.cast`) and **Skilled Run** (`02-skilled.cast`) as a transparent field study—complete with real **Terminal Cast** stop points and **Session Traces**—so you can see the pros and cons of each mode first-hand, and apply them to **your own requirements and project ideas**.

## Published Codelab Lessons {#lessons}

The codelab unfolds across five sequential lessons that follow our three-run experiment from an initial rapid prototype to a cloud-ready architecture:

We begin in **[Lesson 0001: Baseline Vibe-Coding — Rapid Exploration & Its Trade-Offs](lessons/0001-baseline-vibe-coding-for-rapid-exploration.md)** (`01-baseline.cast`), where a single global clarifying-question rule turns a one-sentence prompt into a working prototype in 16 minutes—highlighting both what went right for fast discovery and the eight bugs exposed once the session was cleared with `/clear`.

From there, the next three lessons trace the **Skilled Run** (`02-skilled.cast`). **[Lesson 0002: Wayfinding & Domain Modelling — Durable Intent Across `/clear`](lessons/0002-wayfinding-and-domain-modeling-with-skills.md)** walks through Sessions 1–5, showing how `/wayfinder` and `/domain-modeling` uncovered hierarchical Storage Locations, multi-location Stock Lots, and five-state BOM fulfilment while persisting those decisions in `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs. **[Lesson 0003: UI Prototyping, Specs & Vertical-Slice Tickets](lessons/0003-prototyping-specs-and-vertical-slice-tickets.md)** continues through Sessions 6–8 as we explore interactive layout Variants A, B, and C with `/prototype`, synthesise `spec.md` via `/to-spec`, and slice the work into eight parallelisable vertical tickets with `/to-tickets`. **[Lesson 0004: Worktree TDD, Two-Axis Code Review & Live Browser Verification](lessons/0004-worktree-tdd-code-review-and-browser-verification.md)** completes the Skilled Run in Sessions 9–10, examining how `/implement-spec` orchestrated 11 subagents across isolated git worktrees, what two-axis `/code-review` caught, and why live browser verification still mattered.

Finally, **[Lesson 0005: Capstone Exercise — Productionising on Google Cloud with `google/skills`](lessons/0005-capstone-exercise-productionizing-with-google-cloud-skills.md)** brings the workflow into the **Production Run**, demonstrating how `google/skills` (`cloud-databases-onboarding`, `google-cloud-waf-cost-optimization`, `cloud-run-basics`, and `gcloud`) compose with `/wayfinder` so you can apply the full toolkit to your own project on scale-to-zero Cloud Run and Cloud Firestore.
